## Testing Workflow

### 1. Setup Phase
1. Register two test users
2. Note down their tokens and IDs
3. Create skills in the system
4. Add skills to both user profiles

### 2. Matching Phase
1. User A adds a skill they want to teach
2. User B adds the same skill as something they want to learn
3. Check matches - they should appear in each other's matches

### 3. Exchange Phase
1. User A creates an exchange request to User B
2. User B accepts the exchange
3. Verify exchange status is ACCEPTED

### 4. Session Phase
1. User A (requester) schedules a session
2. Verify session appears in both users' upcoming sessions
3. Mark session as COMPLETED

### 5. Rating Phase
1. Both users can now rate each other (after session is completed)
2. Check rating summary to see average rating and breakdown

## Sample Complete Flow

```bash
# 1. Register Users
TOKEN_ALICE=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Alice", "email": "alice@test.com", "password": "pass123"}' | jq -r '.token')

TOKEN_BOB=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Bob", "email": "bob@test.com", "password": "pass123"}' | jq -r '.token')

# 2. Get Skills
SKILLS=$(curl -s -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/skills \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN_ALICE")

# 3. Add Skills to Profile
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/profile/skills \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN_ALICE" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"skillId": 1, "type": "TEACH", "level": "ADVANCED"}'

# 4. Create Exchange
EXCHANGE=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/exchanges \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN_ALICE" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"receiverId": 2, "offeredSkillId": 1, "wantedSkillId": 9}' | jq -r '.id')

# 5. Accept Exchange (as Bob)
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/api/exchanges/$EXCHANGE/accept \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN_BOB"

# 6. Schedule Session
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/exchanges/$EXCHANGE/sessions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN_ALICE" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"dateTime": "2024-04-10T15:00:00", "durationMinutes": 60, "mode": "ONLINE", "meetLink": "https://zoom.us/j/test"}'
```

## Error Examples

### Validation Error (Missing Field)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Test"
  }'
```

Response:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-04-05T10:30:00",
  "status": 400,
  "error": "Validation Error",
  "message": "email: Email is required; password: Password is required",
  "path": "/api/auth/register"
}
```

### Unauthorized (Missing Token)
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/profile/me
```

Response: Will not include authorization info (depends on security implementation)

### Not Found
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/users/999 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

Response:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-04-05T10:30:00",
  "status": 404,
  "error": "Not Found",
  "message": "User not found",
  "path": "/api/users/999"
}
```

## Tips

- Use `jq` to parse JSON responses: `| jq -r '.id'`
- Set `TOKEN` environment variable to avoid repeating it
- Use `export EXCHANGE_ID=1` to store IDs for later use
- Check response status codes (200, 201, 400, 401, 404, 409)
- Validate JWT tokens at jwt.io if needed
